## DuoDuo cross-border

DuoDuo Cross Border, an overseas platform backed by Made in China, has expanded rapidly and made good money in its first year of launch. It has adopted a new cross-border platform model that opens up new opportunities for Chinese makers. Whether in terms of marketing investment, manufacturing capacity or pricing strategy, DuoDuo Cross Border has taken a series of measures to successfully break through the competition from overseas platforms such as Amazon and Shein.

## Rapid Expansion of DuoDuo Cross-Border

DuoDuo cross-border has rapidly expanded to 37 countries and regions across Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Oceania one year after launching on the U.S. market. According to a Goldman Sachs research report, DuoDuo Cross Border's monthly active users in the North American market reached 42 million, about 60% of Amazon's for the same period. This rapid expansion has brought new opportunities for merchants and factories in China's Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions.

## The way to success of DuoDuo cross-border

DuoDuo cross-border's success is not just due to the traffic and China's supply chain advantages brought about by burning money. Some outside observers summarize it as three reasons: big marketing investments, China's strong manufacturing capacity, and pricing strategy. However, these factors are only part of DuoDuo's cross-border success.

A DuoDuo cross-border merchant from Yiwu shared a new cross-border platform model for the platform - fully managed. This model allows merchants to only be responsible for production, while the platform is responsible for the entire process of placement, operation and logistics. The implementation of this model allows the entire system to operate more efficiently than other e-commerce platforms, creating a scale effect to reduce costs and increase efficiency.

The success of DuoDuo cross-border has also driven other cross-border e-commerce platforms, such as SHEIN, TikTok, Lazada, Shopee, and Sizzler, to go online with the fully managed model. This shows that the fully managed model has become the mainstream of the cross-border industry.

## Changes brought by DuoDuo cross-border to Chinese manufacturers

For Chinese cross-border merchants, DuoDuo cross-border's fully managed model means more convenience. Merchants only need to do the design and production in China, entrust the goods to the platform, and earn real money. They no longer need to bother dealing with the complexities of placement, operations, customer service, logistics, etc., which provides them with new opportunities.

I have been in contact with several DuoDuo cross-border merchants, and they all said they are very satisfied with this model. They feel very relaxed because DuoDuo's cross-border buyers regularly communicate fashion trends, and merchants only need to design styles according to the trends, and then put their products on the shelves after passing the platform's audit. Once the merchandise sales momentum is good, merchants immediately replenish the goods. This model allows merchants to focus on production without having to deal with other complexities on their own.

The simplicity of DuoDuo cross-border is also one of its advantages. Merchants are only responsible for supplying goods, while other aspects such as logistics and operation are all taken care of by the platform. Merchants can focus more on product quality and design, enabling DuoDuo Cross Border to achieve higher net profits.

### Liu Wenhai: Yiwu Hat Merchant

**A Post-90s "Second Generation Factory" Saved His Parents' Foreign Trade Business**

I am one of the first sellers on DuoDuo Cross Border, mainly selling hats. In the top 20 hats on DuoDuo Cross Border, our products occupy nearly one third. Our sales lead by a large margin on every overseas site.

In September last year, I prepared over a dozen styles and quickly launched on DuoDuo Cross Border because I really believe in Pinduoduo. In 2016, I started domestic ecommerce in Yiwu and was one of Pinduoduo's first sellers. Business was booming and I earned enough to buy an apartment directly.

At first I didn't expect much from DuoDuo Cross Border. But soon I saw the backend data rising sharply. I felt the opportunity and profits coming, so I started large scale uploads.

My parents do traditional export business selling hats in Shandong. With the pandemic their orders dropped hugely, goods weren't selling, and they had to pay workers hundreds in salary, very anxious at home. I also put their products on DuoDuo Cross Border and they sold like crazy. My parents couldn't believe it. I had my uncle's factories go into overdrive making products for DuoDuo Cross Border and he made a small fortune.

Not just my family, many of my friends also sold like crazy on DuoDuo Cross Border. No matter how much capacity, goods sell out as soon as uploaded. A friend in accessories business, whose company was about to close, sold directly on DuoDuo Cross Border. This year he already bought a BMW.

I've tried other cross border platforms like AliExpress and Amazon but sales weren't good. When I did AliExpress, I took goods from home and my parents didn't even know how much. They said with your 180 orders a day that's not even enough for living expenses.

But on DuoDuo Cross Border I can sell over 10,000 orders a day, taking up 80% of our capacity. My parents used to prioritize their own orders, fitting me in when machines were free. Now they push back their orders and do mine first. They no longer see me as an idle youth.

### Stories from other DuoDuo cross-border merchants

In addition to Wenhai Liu, there are many other DuoDuo cross-border merchants who have also achieved great success. Their products sell out as soon as they are uploaded on DuoDuo Cross Border, no matter how much capacity they have. A friend in the accessories business, who put his goods up for sale on DuoDuo Cross Border when his company was on the verge of closing down, has now lifted a BMW.

Compared to other platforms, DuoDuo cross-border brings better sales to merchants. Merchants only need to focus on production instead of dealing with complex logistics and operational issues themselves. This model allows them to run their business more efficiently and increase their net profit.

## To summarize

The success of DuoDuo Cross Border has opened up new opportunities for Chinese manufacturers. Through the fully managed model, merchants are able to sell their products more conveniently and profitably in international markets. DuoDuo CrossBorder's rapid expansion and successful model has also led to the development of other cross-border e-commerce platforms. For Chinese cross-border merchants, DuoDuo Cross Border's model and straightforward approach has brought convenience and increased profits.

The success of DuoDuo Cross Border has brought new opportunities to Chinese manufacturers, breaking the limitations of the past, allowing them to earn better profits and changing their business.
