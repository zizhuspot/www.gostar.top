Atherosclerosis can cause emotional disturbances in affected individuals. They may become easily agitated, lack self-control, and gradually become emotionally detached. As the condition progresses, they may lose interest in their surroundings, experience unexplained sadness or happiness, become suspicious, and constantly feel anxious or fearful.

### Impaired Decision-Making

Older adults with atherosclerosis may experience a decline in their ability to concentrate, resulting in reduced imagination and indecisiveness.
